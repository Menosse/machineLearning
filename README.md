Project created to study different approaches to build modules on machine learning guided by https://www.superdatascience.com/
During the project I had the chance to build and enhance my knowledge on Data science, Machine Learning, Deep learning and Neural networks.

Models built are separeted by each folder and each commit has the objective to implement a different model approach for the addressed knowledge areas.
